Linked List
=============

## Easy

+ [merge_two_sorted_lists.py](merge_two_sorted_lists.py)
  - Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list.
  - The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

+ [remove_linked_list_elements.py](remove_linked_list_elements.py)
  - Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.

## Medium

+ [add_two_numbers.py](add_two_numbers.py)
  - You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
    The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
  - Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

+ [copy_list_with_random_pointer.py](copy_list_with_random_pointer.py)
  - A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer
    which could point to any node in the list or null.
  - Return a deep copy of the list.

+ [reorder_list.py](reorder_list.py)
  - Given a singly linked list L0 -> L1 -> ... -> Ln
  - Reorder it to L0 -> Ln -> L1 -> Ln-1 -> ...
