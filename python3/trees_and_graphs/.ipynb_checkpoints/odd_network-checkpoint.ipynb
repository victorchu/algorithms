    "# Odd Network\n",
    "\n",
    "You analyze the performance of a computer network. The network comprises nodes connected by peer-to-peer links. There are N links and N + 1 nodes. All pairs of nodes are (directly or indirectly) connected by links, and links don't form cycles. In other words, the network has a tree topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your analysis shows that communication between two nodes performs much better if the number of links on the (shortest) route between the nodes is odd. Of course, the communication is fastest when the two nodes are connected by a direct link. But, amazingly, if the nodes communicate via 3, 5, 7, etc. links, communication is much faster than if the number of links to pass is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you wonder how this influences the overall network performance. There are N * (N + 1) / 2 different pairs of nodes. You need to compute how many of them are pairs of nodes connected via an odd number of links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are numbered from 0 to N. Links are described by two arrays of integers, A and B, each containing N integers. For each 0 ≤ I < N, there is a link between nodes A[I] and B[I].\n",

    "```\n",
    "def solution(A, B)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "that, given two arrays, A and B, consisting of N integers and describing the links, computes the number of pairs of nodes X and Y, such that 0 ≤ X < Y ≤ N, and X and Y are connected via an odd number of links.\n",
