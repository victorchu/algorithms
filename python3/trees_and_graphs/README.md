Trees and Graphs
================

## Easy
+ binary_tree_paths.py
  - Find all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree.

+ diameter_of_binary_tree.py
  - Compute the diameter (or width) of a binary tree. 

## Medium
+ accounts_merge.py *
  - Merge duplicates account records with name and a list of emails.
  - A good practice on dictionary and set.

+ bst_to_double_linked_list.py *
  -  Convert a Binary Search Tree (BST) to a sorted Circular Doubly-Linked List in place.

+ clone_undirected_graph.py
  - Deep copy a graph.

+ flatten_binary_tree_to_linked_list.py	
  - Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

+ lowest_common_ancestor_binary_tree.py
  - Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
  - Try to traverse the tree only once.

+ number_of_islands.py
  - Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.

+ right_side_view_of_tree.py
  - Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side
    of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

+ validate_binary_search_tree.py
  - Determine if binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST).


## Hard
+ alien_dictionary.py
  - Given a sorted dictionary of an alien language, find order of characters in the language.
  - Topological sorting.

+ max_path_sum.py
  - Find the maximum path sum in a binary tree.

+ shortest_distance_from_all_buildings.py
  - Find the shortest total distance to all buildings in a grid.
  - Use layer-by-layer bread-first search.


## Utilities
+ shared_utils.py
  - class: TreeNode
  - functions: make_tree, tree_to_list, ...
