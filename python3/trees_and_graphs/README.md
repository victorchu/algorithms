    (ie, from left to right, level by level).
  - See Also: [zipzag_level_traversal.py](zipzag_level_traversal.py)

+ [lowest_common_ancestor_binary_tree.py](lowest_common_ancestor_binary_tree.py)
  - Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
  - Try to traverse the tree only once.

+ [number_of_islands.py](number_of_islands.py)
  - Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.

+ [right_side_view_of_tree.py](right_side_view_of_tree.py)
  - Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side
    of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

+ [validate_binary_search_tree.py](validate_binary_search_tree.py)
  - Determine if binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST).

+ [vertical_traversal.py](vertical_traversal.py)
  - Get the binary tree values in the 'vertical' order, from left to right.

+ [word_ladder.py](word_ladder.py)
  - Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the
    length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that
    only one letter can be changed at a time.
  - See Also: [word_ladder2.py](word_ladder2.py)

+ [zipzag_level_traversal.py](zipzag_level_traversal.py)
  - Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. 
    (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
  - See Also: [level_order_traversal.py](level_order_traversal.py)

## Hard
+ [alien_dictionary.py](alien_dictionary.py)
  - Given a sorted dictionary of an alien language, find order of characters in the language.
  - Topological sorting.
  - See Also: [course_schedule.py](course_schedule.py)

+ [cut_off_trees.py](cut_off_trees.py)
  - Given a forest (2D array) of trees of different heights, find the number of steps
    to cut them according to their height order.

+ [max_path_sum.py](max_path_sum.py)
  - Find the maximum path sum in a binary tree.

+ [shortest_distance_from_all_buildings.py](shortest_distance_from_all_buildings.py)
  - Find the shortest total distance to all buildings in a grid.
  - Use layer-by-layer bread-first search.

+ [word_ladder2.py](word_ladder2.py):
  - Given two words (beginWord and endWord) and a dictionary's word list, find all
    shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that
    only one letter can be changed at a time.
  - See Also: [word_ladder.py](word_ladder.py)
